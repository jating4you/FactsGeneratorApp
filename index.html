            "Ancient Survivors: Crocodiles have been around for about 200 million years, making them one of the oldest living reptiles, surviving the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs.",
            "Powerful Bite: Crocodiles have one of the strongest bites in the animal kingdom. Their bite force can reach up to 3,700 pounds per square inch (psi).",
            "Ambush Predators: Crocodiles are excellent hunters. They often lie in wait, partially submerged in water, and ambush their prey with incredible speed and precision.",
            "Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination: The sex of crocodile hatchlings is determined by the temperature of the nest. Warmer temperatures tend to produce males, while cooler temperatures produce females.",
            "Efficient Swimmers: Crocodiles are powerful swimmers, using their tails to propel themselves through the water at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour.",
            "Long Lifespan: Crocodiles can live for a long time, with some species living up to 70 years or more in the wild.",
            "Unique Vocalizations: Crocodiles are known for their vocalizations, which include growls, hisses, and roars. They are one of the few reptiles that can communicate vocally.",
            "Protective Mothers: Female crocodiles are known to be very protective of their nests and young. They guard their eggs and often help the hatchlings reach the water after they emerge.",
            "Salt Glands: Some species of crocodiles, like the saltwater crocodile, have special glands in their tongues that help excrete excess salt, allowing them to live in saline environments.",
            "Heart Structure: Crocodiles have a unique heart with four chambers, similar to birds and mammals, which allows for efficient oxygenation of their blood, supporting their active lifestyle."
